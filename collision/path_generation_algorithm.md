Prep:

‚Ä¢ Generate annular cylinder for tank
‚Ä¢ Generate sphere for PMT top
‚Ä¢ Generate prisms for gantries 

Generation:

‚Ä¢ Simple checks
  - Are final destinations outside range?
  - Will final x‚ÇÄ, x‚ÇÅ cause collision for gantries?
  - Will final positions collide with PMT top?
  - Will final positions collide with tank wall?
‚Ä¢ Simple path generation:
  - Tilt + rotation first
  - Can we move all pos variables at the same time?
    ‚ãÜ Check for collision of enlarged cylinders along path
    ‚ãÜ If collision, find parametric ùë° for collision then check bounding spheres for true collision
    ‚ãÜ False positives for collisions, but no false negatives
  - If no, can we move Z after? (cylinder extrusion for XY, endpoint for Z)
    ‚ãÜ Try each gantry first
  - If no, can we move Z before? (cylinder extrusion for XY, endpoint for Z)
    ‚ãÜ Try each gantry first
  - If no, try each permutation of moving dimensions at the same time in XYZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX, YXZ, XZY order
    ‚ãÜ For each, simply need to check if other dimensions are within tolerance (if moving both in X, then Y and Z positions must be different enough)
  - If no, try each dimension individually for each gantry in every combination (endpoint for all)
  - If no, fail with no multilinear path possible with single gantry movement

Cylinder extrusion algorithm:
‚Ä¢ Find bounding sphere at start and endpoint
‚Ä¢ Use path between centroids to find angle on sphere, find opposing points
‚Ä¢ Generate cylinder with radius equal to bounding spheres, going between opposing points
‚Ä¢ Check cylinders for collision
‚Ä¢

Notes:
 
‚Ä¢ Path generation can be made parallel: simply try each type of path simultaneously, then pick the best one that worked
