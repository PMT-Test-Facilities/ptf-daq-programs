What's done:

• Basic geometric types
• Basic geometric operations
• Most intersections
• (De)serialization for geometric types for storage in ODB
• Rectangular path generation


What's left:

• Rest of intersections
• More types of path generation (cylindrical, variable path length normal, const path length normal)
• More tests
• Integration with ODB
• Integration with feMove
