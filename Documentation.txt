Notes on feMove2:

/************************************COORDINATE FRAME*******************************************/
The LOCAL coordinate frame of each gantry is defined as follows:

Translation (x,y,z): 
  Orientation: 
    The (x,y,z) coordinate frame is chosen such that the x direction is along the gantry mounted 
    to the PTF frame, the y direction is along the gantry mounted on the x gantry, and the z direction 
    is along the vertically mounted gantry.
  Origin: 
    The origin is chosen to be the point on each axis at which a reference point is at the center 
    of the tank in the x and y directions, and is at the top edge of the tank in the z direction. The
    reference point is chosen to be the intersection of the rotary table axis of rotation and the hinge
    axis of rotation for each gantry.
  Positive directions:
    The positive direction for the x-axis is chosen to be the direction towards the other gantry
    The positive direction for the z-axis is chosen to be vertically downwards
    The positive direction for the y axis is chosen to complete a right-hand coordinate frame

Rotation (theta, phi):
  Orientation: 
    Theta is defined to be rotation around the z axis (i.e. around the rotary table axis)
    Phi is defined to be rotation around the box tilt axis
  Origin:
    The origin in theta is chosen to be the point at which the box tilt axis is along the y axis, with
    the box on the negative y side of the rotary table axis
    The origin in phi is chosen to be the point at which the bottom of the box lies parallel to the
    x-y plane
  Positive directions:
    Positive theta rotation is chosen to be positive along the positive z axis
    Positive phi rotation is chosen to be positive in the direction from the box tilt hinge to the box
      

/*************************************ODB VARIABLES*********************************************/

The indices of all array variables in Move2 directory refer to the following axes:
  0 <=> Gantry1 X
  1 <=> Gantry1 Y
  2 <=> Gantry1 Z
  3 <=> Gantry1 Theta (i.e. rotary table)
  4 <=> Gantry1 Phi (i.e. box tilt)
  5 <=> Gantry2 X
  6 <=> Gantry2 Y
  7 <=> Gantry2 Z
  8 <=> Gantry2 Theta (i.e. rotary table)
  9 <=> Gantry2 Phi (i.e. box tilt)

Each variable has the following functionality, units:

"Control":
  Destination: Desired LOCAL destination for the two gantry arms
    Units: meters (for translation) and degrees (for rotation)
    Note 1: While this location is currently defined in the local frame of each gantry, in the
            future, this will be in terms of the global destinations
    Note 2: feMove2 may choose to switch which gantry goes to which set of coordinates if 
            the default configuration is impossible to reach (i.e. gantry 1 will go to the
            coordinates specified by indices 5-9 and gantry 2 will go to indices 0-4). If this 
            occurs, the variable: "Move2/Variables/Swapped" will be set to true.
  
  Start Move: Setting this to yes will initiate a move to the specified destination.
    Units: Boolean
    
  Stop Move: Setting this to yes will stop all motors immediately.
    Units: Boolean
    
  ReInitialize: Setting this to yes will first recalibrate all axes (i.e. send each axes to 
                its limit switch) then initiate a move to the specified coordinates.
    Units: Boolean
    
    
"Settings":
  NOTE: These variables can only be changed when feMove2 is not running. Changing them while the
        program is running will have no effect.
        
  Axis Channels: This array contains the motor channel associated with each axis. The motor 
                 channels are labelled as follows:
                 0 to 7  <=> Controller 1, channels A-H
                 8 to 15 <=> Controller 2, channels A-H
                 -1      <=> Axis disabled 
    Units: integer indices
    
  Motor Scaling: This array contains the scaling between motor steps and physical motion (in the
                 local frame)for each axis
    Units: meters/motor-step (translation) and degrees/motor-step (for rotation)


  Velocity: This array contains the desired velocity (in physical units) of the various axes
    Units: meters/second (translation) and degrees/second (rotation)
    
  Acceleration: This array contains the desired velocity (in physical units) of the various axes
    Units: meters/second^2 (translation) and degrees/second^2 (rotation)
  
  Limit Positions: This array contains the physical location of the limit switch on each axis
                   in each gantry's local frame (see coordinate system section for details
                   about where the origin is defined to be)
    Units: meters (translation) and degrees (rotation)
  
"Variables":
  Position: The current position of each gantry (current implementation: local frame, future
            implementation: global frame)
    Units: meters (translation) and degrees (rotation)
  Initialized: Whether or not the system is initialized
    Units: Boolean
  Swapped: Whether or not the gantry destinations have been swapped from the user input
    Units: Boolean
  Completed: Whether or not the system has reached the desired destination
    Units: Boolean
  Moving: Whether or not the system is moving
    Units: Boolean
  Axis Moving: Whether or not each axis is moving
    Units: Boolean
  Axis Limit: Whether or not each axis' limit switch has been triggered.
    Units: Boolean
